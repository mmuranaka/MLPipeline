### This is the respository for the Complete Machine Learning Pipeline project. The task of this project was to build a successful model for the given 15-dimensional dataset containing 1.2 million observations.

- `project-guidelines.pdf` info on the project guidelines.
- `project-pipeline.html` contains an easy to view pipeline process.
- `project-notebook.ipynb` is the actual python notebook used to conduct everything.
- `model-export.pmml` is the deployable model.
- Not in this respository is the dataset file due to github file size constraints
